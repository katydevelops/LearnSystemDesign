Event-Driven Architecture

- Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design pattern where components communicate by producing and consuming events. An event represents a significant change in state


Characteristics:
    - Events as Communication: components generate and respond to events

    - Decoupled Components: components are loosely coupled, interacting primarily through Events

    - Asynchronous Processing: events are often processed asynchronously, allowing for high scalability and responsiveness


Advantages:
    - Scalability: naturally supports scaling processing events in parallel

    - Flexibility: easy to add new event consumers without modifying existing producers 

    - Responsiveness: can handle a high volume of events with low latency


Disadvantages:
    -  Complexity: managing event flows and ensuring event consistency can be challenging

    - Debugging: tracing and debugging issues across multiple event-driven components can be difficult

    - Event Management: requires robust handling and monitoring infrastructure
