Monolithic

- monolithic architecture is a traditional software architecture model where all components of an application are packaged and deployed as a single unit


Characteristics:

    - Single Codebase: all functionality is contained within a single codebase

    - Tightly Coupled Components: components are interconnected and interdependent

    - Single Deployment Unit: the entire application is deployed at once


Advantages:

    - Simplicity: easier to develop, test and deploy initially

    - Performance: can have better performance due to fewer network calls between components

    - Consistency: easier to maintain consistency and data integrity 


Disadvantages:

    - Scalability: difficult to scale individual components independently

    - Complexity Over Time: as the application grows, the codebase can become large and unwieldy

    - Deployment Risks: a change in one part of the application requires redeployment of the entire system, increasing the risk of downtime
