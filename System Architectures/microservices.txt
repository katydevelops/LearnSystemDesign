Microservices Architecture

- Microservices break down a application into smaller, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service is responsible for a specific piece of functionality. 


Characteristics:
    - Decoupled Services: each service is self-contained and operates independently

    - Specific Functionality: each service focuses on a specific business capability

    - Independent Deployment: services can be developed, tests and deployed independently


Advantages:
    - Scalability: individual services can be scaled independently based on demand
    
    - Flexibility: easier to adopt new technologies and update services without affecting the entire system
    
    - Resilience: failure in one service doesn't necessarily affect the others


Disadvantages:
    - Complexity: increased complexity in managing multiple services, including network communication and data consistency

    - Deployment Overhead: requires sophisticated deployment and monitoring infrastructure

    - Inter-Service Communication: can introduce latency and require robust communication mechanisms
