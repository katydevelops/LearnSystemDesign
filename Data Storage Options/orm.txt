Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

- technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using an object-oriented paradigm. It abstracts the database interactions, enabling developers to work with database records as if they were objects


Key Concepts
    - Entities: objects that represent database tables
    
    - Attributes: properties of entities that represent columns in tables

    - Relationships: associations between entities that mirror foreign key Relationships

    - Query Abstraction: high-level methods to perform CRUD operations without writing raw SQL


Advantages
    - Productivity: reduces boilerplate code and improves development speed

    - Maintainability: easier to manage database interactions within the application code

    - Portability: abstracts database-specific details, allowing for easier database switching


Disadvantages
    - Performance: may introduce overhead and inefficiencies compared to raw SQL

    - Complex Queries: can be less efficient for complex queries or operations
