NoSQL Databases

- designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They are optimized for horizontal scaling and provide flexible schema designs

- They use key-value stores: use a simple data model where each record is a pair consisting of a unique key and its associated value

    - Keys: unique identifies for each record
    - Values: data associated with keys, which can be of any type (strings, numbers, objects, etc)


Advantages
    - Performance: extremely fast read and write operations
    - Scalability: easy to scale horizontally

Disadvantages
    - Simplicity: limited querying capabilities and structure
